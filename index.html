	  <p>A physicist and his wife are traveling north on US Highway 99 north of Bakersfield, 
	  California, and pull off to the side to watch a long, slender object of a blazing red, 
	  green, and yellow color moving about 8 miles east of them. It is traveling at about 50 
	  mph at an altitude of 200–300 feet and is clearly outlined against the foothills. It 
	  seems to be several times longer than a bomber. (“Recent Sightings,” APRO Bulletin,

	  <p>1:00 a.m. A woman returning home in Prouvy, Nord, France, finds herself face-to-face with 
	  three small entities with large round heads and short beards. They have large, luminous yellow 
	  eyes and wear tight, one-piece suits with a metallic sheen that leave only their faces exposed. 
	  The beings stare at her without moving, so she goes inside to get her husband, but by the time 
	  they return the entities have gone. (Center for UFO Studies, HUMCAT Index 1940–1949, p. 3;

	  <p>May 26 — Late night. Capt. Ray Smith and copilot Sgt. Gordon N. Cockcroft are flying at 
	  18,000 feet in a Halifax bomber on a run near Essen, Germany, when they see a silvery-gold 
	  cylindrical object, larger than their aircraft, on the port side. It has several evenly 
	  spaced portholes. It is hovering at a 45° angle. After 20–30 seconds it climbs away at high 
	  speed. (Norman Oliver, “Report—Extra!” BUFORA Journal 6, no. 3 (Sept./Oct. 1977): cover,

	  <p>July 18 — A French prisoner in a German labor camp near Gdynia, Poland, is walking to work 
	  along the Baltic Sea when he sees a flat, metallic object embedded in the sand. A human figure 
	  is standing next to it, apparently trying to dig it up. When he passes by, the figure, 
	  apparently an Asian woman with long blonde hair and dressed in a tight-fitting overall, turns 
	  in his direction. The witness assumes she is the famous German aviator Hanna Reitsch and helps 
	  her dig the experimental aircraft out of the sand. The object is 20 feet in diameter and looks 
	  like two metallic saucers put together. The woman touches the witness’s chest with her hand 
	  and points to the sky. She touches her belt and a door in the object opens. She crawls inside, 
	  the door closes, and the object ascends and departs at a tremendous speed. (Jean Sider,

	  <p>January 2 — The New York Times publishes an article stating that the foo fighters are 
	  German weapons. Lieut. Donald J. Meiers of the 415th Night Fighter Squadron says he has been 
	  followed by foo-fighters twice in November 1944. “A foo-fighter picked me up at 700 feet and 
	  chased me 20 miles down the Rhine Valley [Germany]. I turned to starboard and two balls of

      <p>Mid-February — As their C-47 prepares to land at Biggs Field, Fort Bliss, El Paso, Texas, 
	  S/Sgt Ralph Bayer is alarmed to see an aircraft approaching from the left and only 900 feet

      <p>Late March — At least two residents of Dresden, Germany, see a round, flat, silver-colored 
	  object without propellors or wings hovering silently in the air. It suddenly disappears like 
	  a “burst soap bubble.” (“Weltrundschau,” Weltraumbote, no. 32/22 (July/Aug. 1958): 14–15;

      <p>March 26 — During an air operation, Lieut. Calvin P. Lamb (pilot), Lieut. James G. Holmes 
	  (radar observer), and Sgt. John W. McIsaac (gunner) notice lights on an airborne object. The 
	  lights follow them through a few turns but move away as the crew orbits north of Iwo Jima, 
	  Japan. They give chase, obtaining a slight target on the aircraft radar, then the object pulls 
	  out of sight. A similar lighted object is again seen March 28 by Lieut. William F. Sill 
	  (pilot), Flight Officer George W. Hayden (radar observer), and PFC William Brasvell (gunner).

      <p>December 25 — A witness is standing on the shore during a blizzard on a small island off 
	  the west coast of Ireland, waiting for a boat that will return him to the mainland, when a 
	  silver domed object with a square base descends from the clouds and lands on the water. It 
	  is surrounded by purple lights and emits a whirring noise, resembling a drill. The object 
	  rises again and lands in a field, crushing two cows. The top of the craft slides open, and 
	  two humanoid figures with “squarish legs” and wearing gray-black rubber suits emerge. One 
	  of them walks across the water to the shore, placing a large vial on the ground. The other 
	  fires a red ray at a cow, burning through it. A farmer’s dog approaches, barking, but the 
	  humanoid points a “box with lights and antennae” at it, hypnotizing the dog. The dog then 
	  walks up to the UFO and is taken aboard. Five or six similar craft streak overhead as a mist
	  envelops the UFO. Both beings float back into the craft. Before leaving, one of the beings 
	  notices the witness and waves. Startled, the witness runs away. The farmer later advises the 
	  witness to keep the experience a secret. (Mark Malony, “A New Irish Close Encounter Report,”

      <p>Summer — Late evening. Two women on a walk in Johannesburg, South Africa, see an aerial 
	  object hovering 5 feet above the roof of a nearby hotel. It is shaped like a saucer with a 
	  round, golden ball in the center, evenly split between the top and bottom sections. They 
	  hear a clicking noise, and the ball drops through the saucer until it is level with the 
	  roof. More clicks are heard, and the ball rises through and above the saucer 8–9 feet. 
	  In the space between the ball and the disc the witnesses see two figures larger than 
	  normal height (7 feet), fair-complexioned and broad-shouldered, with short wavy hair. They 
	  are wearing white uniforms with stiff collars and stand motionless until the object floats 
	  away and is lost to view. (John Judge, “Near-Landing in 1946 in Johannesburg,” Flying Saucer

	  Barney stops the car at a scenic picnic area south of Twin Mountain. Through binoculars, 
	  Betty sees a solid object against the moon that “appeared to be flashing thin pencils of 
	  different colored lights.” Barney thinks it’s a plane, though it might be “playing games” 
	  with them. Barney drives slowly through Franconia Notch, watching the object. At one point it 
	  passes near the Old Man of the Mountain. About one mile south of Indian Head (north of 
	  Lincoln), the object rapidly descends toward their vehicle, causing Barney to stop in the 
	  middle of the highway. The huge, silent craft hovers approximately 80–100 feet above the 
	  Hills’ 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air and fills the entire field of view in the windshield. It 
	  reminds Barney of a huge pancake. Carrying his pistol in his pocket, he steps away from the 
	  vehicle and moves closer to the object. Using the binoculars, Barney claims see about 8–11 
	  humanoid figures who are peering out of the craft’s windows, seeming to look at him. In unison, 
	  all but one figure move to what appears to be a panel on the rear wall of the hallway that 
	  encircles the front portion of the craft. The one remaining figure continues to look at 
	  Barney and communicates a message telling him to “stay where you are and keep looking.” Barney 
	  has a recollection of observing the humanoid forms wearing glossy black uniforms and black 
	  caps. Red lights on what appears to be bat-wing fins begin to telescope out of the sides of 
	  the craft, and a long structure descends from the bottom of the craft. The UFO approaches to 
	  within 50–80 feet overhead and 300 feet away from him. Barney tears the binoculars away from 
	  his eyes and runs back to his car. In a near hysterical state, he tells Betty, “They’re going 
	  to capture us!” He sees the object again shift its location to directly above the vehicle. He 
	  drives away at high speed, telling Betty to look for the object. She rolls down the window 
	  and looks up. Almost immediately, the Hills hear a rhythmic series of beeping or buzzing 
	  sounds which seem to bounce off the trunk of their vehicle. The car vibrates and a tingling 
	  sensation passes through them. At this point in time they experience the onset of an altered
	  state of consciousness that leaves their minds dulled. A second series of beeping sounds 
	  return them to full consciousness. They find that they have traveled nearly 35 miles south, 
	  but have only vague, spotty memories of this section of road. They recall making a sudden, 
	  unplanned turn, encountering a roadblock, and observing a fiery orb in the road. At 5:00 a.m., 
	  they arrive home, about two hours later than expected. Barney feels compelled to examine his 
	  genitals, and they both take long showers. Betty notices a pinkish powder and a tear in her 
	  dress. There are shiny, concentric circles on their car’s trunk that were not there the 
	  previous day. Betty and Barney experiment with a compass, noting that when they move it close

      <p>September 19 — 6:50 p.m. More than 140 residents of Wonthaggi and South Dudley, Victoria, 
	  Australia, observe a mystery object like an orange beach ball maneuver in the sky for 25 
	  minutes. At first it hovers, then it begins moving slowly and silently, putting on sudden 
	  and intermittent bursts of speed, before disappearing in an easterly direction into the Bass 
	  Strait. During the 25 minutes that the object is visible, TV sets malfunction in South 
	  Dudley, Wonthaggi, and lnverlock. TV sets variously display white screens, gray screens, 
	  double images, or snow and lines. Still other sets go completely blank. After the UFO leaves 
	  at 7:15, all TV sets resume normal operation. (“UAO’s Upset TV Reception,” APRO Bulletin, May 
	  1964, pp. 1, 6; Schopick, pp. 109–111)</p>

	  <p>January 1 — Many witnesses in Shanghai, China, see a huge cigar-shaped UFO flying toward 
	  the southwest. MiG fighters are scrambled in pursuit but fail to intercept it. The official 
	  explanation is that it is a US missile. (Wendelle Stevens and Paul Dong, UFOs over Modern

      <p>1964, January 4 — Barney Hill has his first hypnosis session with Benjamin Simon. The 
	  sessions will continue until June 6. The Hills undergo sessions separately, and for the most 
	  part are instructed not to remember their experiences afterwards. Barney’s sessions are 
	  particularly intense. However, by the end of the sessions, although they disagree with Simon 
	  on the nature of the experience, both the Hills and Simon agree that the therapy is successful. 
	  The stress and anxiety are gone. Simon submits a statement to the Hills’ insurance company, 
	  which initially declines to pay, until Simon explains that he was treating them for what will 
	  later be called PTSD. ([audio excerpts from the complete hypnosis sessions conducted by 
	  Benjamin Simon on Barney Hill, 1964], in “CEIV: An Audio History of Alien Abduction and

      <p>April 3 — 9:00 p.m. R. Wold, a graduate student in anthropology at the University of 
	  Wisconsin, and three others are heading west on County Highway C about one mile west of 
	  Monticello, Wisconsin. They notice two blinking red lights in the distance that they think 
	  might be police cars. However, they are too far above the ground and begin approaching. The 
	  object slows down to a hover behind some telephone wires about 300 feet from the car. By 
	  this time they have stopped the car and can see four red lights in a rectangular formation 
	  and one white light in front of the others, but no underlying structure. The object passes 
	  slowly beyond them, so Wold turns the car around and tries to chase the lights but they 
	  disappear to the east. (Sparks, p. 296; Olsen, sec. 3, pp. 88–89)</p>

	  <p>January 12 — 8:20 p.m. A Mrs. Jubert in Custer, Washington, sees through her window what 
	  seems to be the landing lights of an airplane apparently coming into her yard. She herds her 
	  three teenage girls outside in the opposite direction. The four lights merge into one intense 
	  white light, which moves in a straight line toward the house, lifts several hundred feet and 
	  clears a clump of evergreens, then dips down on the far side and touches the ground. A border 
	  patrol officer also sees the object after he is alerted by radio. He is buzzed by the UFO, 
	  which is low enough that he stops his car, gets out, and watches it move out of sight. Where 
	  the object lands in 16 inches of snow, they find a large circular imprint about 10–12 feet in 
	  diameter. The ground beneath the melted snow ring shows evidence of having been scorched. Oval-
	  shaped tracks 8 inches long and 8 inches apart, in a single file, are found leading from the 
	  landing site to the evergreens, where they disappear. One month later, the circular area still 
	  shows traces. (NICAP, “Case 188s”; “New Sightings Put AF on Spot,” UFO Investigator 3, no. 1

	  <p>February 3 — 8:45 p.m. A man sees a light on the beach near Penguin Street, South New

	  returns with other witnesses and a dog that gets restless at a spot where grass is flattened. 
	  Another witness sees the UFO as it is rising above the suburb. (“Sighting Reports, New

      <p> Jean-Jacques Velasco coauthors OVNIs: La science avance, with journalist Jean-Claude

      <p>The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) facility begins construction 
	  north of Gakona, Alaska, just west of Wrangell–Saint Elias National Park, funded by the Air 
	  Force, Navy, University of Alaska Fairbanks, and DARPA. Its original purpose is to analyze 
	  the ionosphere and investigate the potential for developing ionospheric enhancement technology 
	  for radio communications and surveillance. As a university-owned facility, HAARP is a high-
	  power, high-frequency transmitter used for study of the ionosphere. The most prominent 
	  instrument at HAARP is the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), a high-power radio frequency
	  transmitter facility operating in the high frequency band. The IRI is used to temporarily 
	  excite a limited area of the ionosphere. Other instruments, such as a VHF and a UHF radar, a 
	  fluxgate magnetometer, a digisonde (an ionospheric sounding device), and an induction 
	  magnetometer, are used to study the physical processes that occur in the excited region.

	  <p> January 1 — 1:30 a.m. A taxi driver has just dropped off revelers at a remote house in 
	  Hethersgill, Cumbria, England. She heads home down a remote track toward the main road when 
	  suddenly her CB radio begins to crackle then fades entirely. Moments later her car engine and 
	  lights fail, and she coasts to a stop. She gets out, hoping to walk back to the house, when 
	  she sees a ball of light low over the road heading towards her. It swoops over her car and 
	  shoots into the sky, causing her skin to tingle. The headlights come back on, the car lurches 
	  forward, and she hears her sister talking on the CB asking where she has been for the past 30 
	  minutes. (Jenny Randles, “The Twelve UFOs of Christmas,” Fortean Times 374 (Christmas 2018):
