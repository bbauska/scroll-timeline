	  <p>A physicist and his wife are traveling north on US Highway 99 north of Bakersfield, 
	  California, and pull off to the side to watch a long, slender object of a blazing red, 
	  green, and yellow color moving about 8 miles east of them. It is traveling at about 50 
	  mph at an altitude of 200–300 feet and is clearly outlined against the foothills. It 
	  seems to be several times longer than a bomber. (“Recent Sightings,” APRO Bulletin, 
	  January 1957, p. 5)</p>
      <h2 class="milestone">1942</h2>
	  <p>1:00 a.m. A woman returning home in Prouvy, Nord, France, finds herself face-to-face with 
	  three small entities with large round heads and short beards. They have large, luminous yellow 
	  eyes and wear tight, one-piece suits with a metallic sheen that leave only their faces exposed. 
	  The beings stare at her without moving, so she goes inside to get her husband, but by the time 
	  they return the entities have gone. (Center for UFO Studies, HUMCAT Index 1940–1949, p. 3;

      <h2 class="milestone">1943</h2>
	  <p>May 26 — Late night. Capt. Ray Smith and copilot Sgt. Gordon N. Cockcroft are flying at 
	  18,000 feet in a Halifax bomber on a run near Essen, Germany, when they see a silvery-gold 
	  cylindrical object, larger than their aircraft, on the port side. It has several evenly 
	  spaced portholes. It is hovering at a 45° angle. After 20–30 seconds it climbs away at high 
	  speed. (Norman Oliver, “Report—Extra!” BUFORA Journal 6, no. 3 (Sept./Oct. 1977): cover,

	  Words, 2010, pp. 33–34)</p>
	  <p>July 18 — A French prisoner in a German labor camp near Gdynia, Poland, is walking to work 
	  along the Baltic Sea when he sees a flat, metallic object embedded in the sand. A human figure 
	  is standing next to it, apparently trying to dig it up. When he passes by, the figure, 
	  apparently an Asian woman with long blonde hair and dressed in a tight-fitting overall, turns 
	  in his direction. The witness assumes she is the famous German aviator Hanna Reitsch and helps 
	  her dig the experimental aircraft out of the sand. The object is 20 feet in diameter and looks 
	  like two metallic saucers put together. The woman touches the witness’s chest with her hand 
	  and points to the sky. She touches her belt and a door in the object opens. She crawls inside, 
	  the door closes, and the object ascends and departs at a tremendous speed. (Jean Sider, 
	  Ultra Top-Secret: Ces OVNIs qui font peur, Axis Mundi, 1990)</p>
	  <p>September — During an air battle between the Germans and Russians, a member of the Spanish 
	  Blue Division fighting with the Germans near Pushkin outside Leningrad [now Saint Petersburg], 
	  Russia, notices a disc-shaped object above the planes. It appears to be observing the battle, 
	  then disappears at a fantastic speed. (Antonio Ribera, Platillos Volantes en Iberoamerica y 
	  España, Santiago Pomaire, 1968, pp. 411–412)</p>
      <h2 class="milestone">1944</h2>
	  <p>February 24 —Night. Southwest of Saint-Quentin, Aisne, France, three silver objects are 
	  seen by an RAF bomber returning from a mission over Schweinfurt, Germany. They resemble 
	  Zeppelins but move independently of the wind. (Strange Company 60)</p>
      <h2 class="milestone">1945</h2>
      <h2 class="milestone">1946</h2>
	  <p>July — Day. A long, silver-colored cigar appears suddenly out of the haze over Crane Beach, Ipswich,
Massachusetts, moves noiselessly over the water, then disappears suddenly. (Lore and Deneault, p. 148; Clark III
1179; Clark IV 1353)</p>
      <p>July — 2:00 p.m. Hans Sorensen is cycling near Viskinge, Denmark, when he sees three discs flying silently
overhead. The underside is uneven and dull gray, but they are like “polished mirrors” on top. (Sjællands Tidende
(Ringsted, Denmark), April 17, 1971; Loren E. Gross, UFO’s, a History: 1946, the Ghost Rockets, The Author,
1988 ed., p. 16; Clark III 528; Clark IV 577)</p>
      <p>August — 8:30 p.m. A young man sees a pan-shaped object near a road in Sint-Niklaas, Belgium. A small entity
holding an acacia branch is nearby. The being enters the object through an opening on the underside. Afterward,
traces of burning on the ground are detected. (Center for UFO Studies, HUMCAT Index 1940–1949, p. 20; Clark
III 266; Clark IV 306)</p>
      <p>Late August — Margaret Sprankle, a civilian employee at Tinker AFB near Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is returning
from work when she sees, about 300 feet away, a large, metallic, lens-shaped structure about 75 feet in diameter.
It is hovering on edge, the flat side toward her. On the lower right side are 12–14 square windows; in each, visible
from the shoulders up, is a figure. Their heads are very round. Aftre about 90 seconds, the object rotates 90° on its
vertical axis and silently flies northwest and disappears in 5 seconds. (Center for UFO Studies, HUMCAT Index

      <h2 class="milestone">1947</h2>
	  <p>Late April or early May — 12:05 p.m. Mrs. William Down and Mrs. H. G. Olavick of Tucson, Arizona, see an
unusual, fleecy cloud in an otherwise cloudless sky. Moving around it in “yo-yo fashion” are a number of small
discs with a dull-white finish. They move up and down and sideways, occasionally disappearing into or behind
the cloud. They watch the objects for 5–7 minutes, then all the discs disappear above the cloud, while a larger 
object emerges from the cloud and moves eastward. Behind it comes a V-formation of nine of the smaller discs,
which then climbs at high speed toward the northeast and disappears in 2–3 seconds. The witnesses assume the
objects are some new type of aircraft. (Bloecher, p. ix; Herbert S. Taylor, “Satellite Objects and Cloud Cigars,”
IUR 29, no. 1 (Spring 2004): 4)</p>
      <p>May — Farmer H. Nettlebeck is in his field near Gogeldrie, New South Wales, when he hears a swishing noise.
Looking up, he sees five metallic objects flying in a V formation. They appear to be at 2,000 feet altuitude and
moving at 1,000 mph. (“Flying Discs Seen over Gogeldrie,” Murrumbidgee Irrigator (Leeton, N.S.W.), July 8,
1947, p. 2)</p>
      <p>May 19 — Around 12:30 p.m. Navy veteran Dean A. Hauser and six other Pike’s Peak Railway workers (including
Ted Weigand, Marion Hisshouse, T. J. Smith, L. D. Jamison) at Manitou Springs, Colorado, are taking a lunch
break when they watch a silver object come in from the northwest, hover overhead, and gyrate at 1,000 feet. The
UFO is moving “erratically in wide circles” and reflects light like it is made of metal. After 20 minutes it
disappears in a straight line to the west-northwest. (“Manitou Vets Relate Story: Another ‘Disk’ Seen,” Denver
Post, June 28, 1947, p. 1; Bloecher, p. I-1; Loren E. Gross, The Fifth Horseman of the Apocalypse: UFOs, a

419)</p>
      <p>Late May — 11:00 a.m. Colden R. Battey, a physician from Augusta, Georgia, is fishing 10 miles off St. Helena
Sound, near Beaufort, South Carolina. He notices a formation of four disc-like objects flying overhead in a
southeasterly direction at a terrific rate of speed. The discs appear to be spinning on their axes and are at an
estimated altitude of 20,000 feet. They are silvery and appear highly polished, and on their undersides Battey can
see a circular rim or projection, about one-quarter of the way from the edges. No sound is heard as they fly
overhead. The formation speeds out of view in less than 20 seconds. (NICAP, “Four Discs Flying Overhead”;
“‘Flying Saucers’ Seen by Doctor near Beaufort,” Orangeburg (S.C.) Times and Democrat, July 5, 1947, p. 1;
Bloecher, p. I-2; Clark III 375; Clark IV 419)</p>
      <p>June 2 — 1:30 p.m. John Laube and Fred Platte spot an inverted saucer-shaped disc made of brilliant metal in
Waverly, Iowa. The object flies just above the top of a 180-foot grain elevator at the Waverly Sugar
Manufacturing Plant. They observe it for five minutes until it becomes obscured by trees as it flies away. (“Flying
Saucer Is Seen at Waverly,” Waterloo (Iowa) Daily Courier, July 10, 1947, p. 21)</p>
      <p>June 18 — Day. E. H. Sprinkle is one of a half-dozen Eugene, Oregon, residents who spot a formation of round
objects “racing overhead” on a course to the northeast. Watching from Skinner’s Butte outside town. Sprinkle
takes a snapshot of the objects with an inexpensive camera as they race over. Enlargements of the photograph
show “seven dots” in a formation “shaped like an X or a Y, lined up across the sky.” Newspaper photographers
say the dots “might be a fault in the developing process” that sometimes appears on a negative that has not been
agitated properly in the developer. (“Local Man Asserts Flights Seen Here,” Eugene (Oreg.) Guard, June 26,
1947, p. 1; “Others Report Flying Discs,” Salem (Oreg.) Capital Journal, June 27, 1947, p. 13; “Reports of
Puzzling ‘Discs’ Flying over Cascades Come from Northwest Residents,” Roseburg (Oreg.) News-Review, June
27, 1947, p. 1; Bloecher, p. IV-3)</p>
      <p>July 4 — 1:05–5:30 p.m. Many people in Portland, Oregon—including KOIN newsman Frank Cooley, deputy
Clark County Sheriff Fred Krives, Portland police officer Kenneth A. McDowell, and Oregon highway patrol Sgt.
Claude Cross—view five large discs moving at high speed to the east, two flying south and three to the east, with
an oscillating or wobbling motion, sudden 90° turns or zigzagging. Radio reports alert other officers (including
Walter Lissy, Robert Ellis, and Earl Patterson, all WWII veterans) who see the metallic objects that look like a
disc or hubcap or pie-pan or half-moon flashing in the sun. No vapor trail or noise (except possible humming) is
reported. (NICAP, “Seven Discs Observed by Many Witnesses”; Sparks, p. 20; “Air Liner Crew Confirms Flying

      <p>July 5 — 5:00 a.m. Archaeologists, including William Curry Holden, working the sites around Roswell, New
Mexico, stumble across an impact site where an object has crashed. One of them heads to the closest phone to tell
Sheriff George A. Wilcox of the discovery of the remains of a crashed aircraft of some kind. Wilcox calls the
local fire department to alert them about the crash. One truck, with Dan Dwyer on it, responds to the call. The site
is about 35–40 miles north of Roswell. The Roswell Fire Department, escorted by members of the Roswell Police
Department, makes a run along Pine Lodge Road northwest of Roswell. They are among the first civilians to
stumble across the impact site. (Thomas J. Carey, “The Search for the Roswell Archaeologists: Casting the Net,”

      <p>July 5 — Following the rain the night before, Brazel inspects the pastures surrounding the J. B. Foster ranch house
southeast of Corona, New Mexico. Riding with him is the young son of the Proctors, William D. Proctor. During
the inspection, Brazel discovers a large debris field. Scattered on the slopes and into the sinkhole and depressions
are plastic-like beams, pieces of lightweight balsawood-like material only stronger, light metallic foil (which
doesn’t stay bent or folded, resumes its original shape, and won’t tear), and heavy-gauge monofilament. The
debris is thick enough that the sheep refuse to cross the field and are driven around it to water more than a mile
away. Brazel, taking a few scraps of the material, heads to the home of his closest neighbors, Floyd and Loretta
Proctor. He shows them “a little sliver” of material that he can neither burn nor cut. Some of the beams have
symbols on them that reminds Brazel of Chinese ideograms. The Proctors suggest he take it into town to show the
sheriff. (Don Schmitt and Kevin D. Randle, “Did a Balloon Crash at Roswell?” IUR 15, no. 4 (July/Aug. 1990):

	  <p>February — 2:00 a.m. Glancing out his window while getting a drink of water, farmer C. Bruce Stevenson notices a
bight orange-amber glow near his farm buildings a few miles from Circleville, Ohio. He expects to find the
buildings on fire, but instead there is a large, domed flying saucer gliding silently over the roof of his pig house
about 100 feet away. The UFO, about 60 feet in diameter, maintains a slow speed and low altitude until it
disappears from sight. (“Bruce Stevenson Reveals Close-Up View of Saucer,” Circleville (Ohio) Herald, August

      <p>May 28 — 3:00 p.m. USAF Reserve 1st Lt. Alexander Kokolonis is flying a C-47 at 6,000 feet six miles east of
Monroe, Michigan, when he sees out of the navigator’s window three discs 2 miles to the left. He estimates they
are 300–400 feet in diameter, silvery-gold, and traveling well over 500 mph. They are seen for only 10–15
seconds. Shortly afterwards, Kokolonis sees two similar objects and he alerts M/Sgt Ernest Davis Jr., who also
sees them. (NICAP, “Air Force Transport Buzzed by 3 UFOs”; Michael D. Swords, “Project Sign and the
Estimate of the Situation,” JUFOS 7 (2000): 45)</p>
      <h2 class="milestone">1949</h2>
	  <p>January 1 — 5:00 p.m. Pilot Thomas A. Rush and his wife are in a private plane with two passengers flying east of
Jackson, Mississippi, into North Jackson Airpark. They see a cigar-shaped object, 60 feet long and 10 feet wide,
cross their path at an altitude of 1,500–1,600 feet. It is only about 500 feet distant and seems to be either dark blue
or black in color. It is shaped like a megaphone, tapering from a diameter of roughly 10 feet at the front end to
four feet at the trailing end. Its speed is approximately 200 mph, and it accelerates to 400–500 mph. The object
makes a 50° turn and is visible for 10–12 seconds. (NICAP, “Cigar-Shaped Object Encountered by Bush Pilot”;

      <h2 class="milestone">1950</h2>
	  <p>January — On the Seattle, Washington, to Anchorage, Alaska, route, an air freighter is paced for five minutes by a
UFO. When the pilots try to close in, the craft zooms away at terrific speed. Later, the airline head reports that
intelligence officers quizzed the pilots for hours. “From their questions,” he said, “I could tell they had a good
idea of what the saucers are. One officer admitted they did, but he wouldn’t say any more.” (Keyhoe 1950, p. 9)</p>
      <p>February 26 — 2:45 p.m. Three witnesses observe a bronze-colored object that looks like two cigarette ashtrays
placed face to face over Vancouver, British Columbia. It slows down as it passes overhead and wobbles as it
moves along. (Chris Rutkowski, Canada’s UFOs: Declassified, August Night, 2022, p. 64)</p>

	  <p>January 20 — 7:20 p.m. Two master sergeants, both intelligence specialists, are walking down a street at Fairchild
AFB near Spokane, Washington, when they notice a large, bluish-white, spherical object approaching from the
east. It passes north of their position, traveling horizontally and silently, and disappears in the west. They notice it
has a long blue tail. It travels underneath low cloud cover at 4,700 feet at 1,400 mph. (NICAP, “Large Sphere
with Blue Tail at 500ʹ”; Sparks, p. 118; Ruppelt, p. 12)</p>

      <p> Jean-Jacques Velasco coauthors OVNIs: La science avance, with journalist Jean-Claude 
	  Bourret, in which he admits the physical reality of UFOs and the probability of their 
	  extraterrestrial origin. He stresses that it’s his personal opinion, although he has been 
	  authorized by CNES to write the book. Its foreword is written by astrophysicist Jean-Claude 
	  Ribes, president of the French Astronomical Society. (Jean-Claude Bourret and Jean-Jacques 
	  Velasco, OVNIs: La science avance, Laffont, 1993;<br>
	  Gildas Bourdais, “From GEPAN to SEPRA: Official UFO Studies in France,” IUR 25, no. 4 
	  (Winter 2000–2001): 13).</p>
      <p>The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) facility begins construction 
	  north of Gakona, Alaska, just west of Wrangell–Saint Elias National Park, funded by the Air 
	  Force, Navy, University of Alaska Fairbanks, and DARPA. Its original purpose is to analyze 
	  the ionosphere and investigate the potential for developing ionospheric enhancement technology 
	  for radio communications and surveillance. As a university-owned facility, HAARP is a high-
	  power, high-frequency transmitter used for study of the ionosphere. The most prominent 
	  instrument at HAARP is the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), a high-power radio frequency
	  transmitter facility operating in the high frequency band. The IRI is used to temporarily 
	  excite a limited area of the ionosphere. Other instruments, such as a VHF and a UHF radar, a 
	  fluxgate magnetometer, a digisonde (an ionospheric sounding device), and an induction 
	  magnetometer, are used to study the physical processes that occur in the excited region.

	  “About HAARP”; John Greenewald, “The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program,” The 
	  Black Vault, March 13, 2023).</p>
      <p> Steven M. Greer founds the Disclosure Project in Crozet, Virginia, the goal of which is 
	  to publicly disclose the government’s alleged knowledge of UFOs, extraterrestrial intelligence, 
	  and advanced energy and propulsion systems. (Steven M. Greer, “Project Background,” The 
	  Disclosure Project, April 2001).</p>
	  <p> January 1 — 1:30 a.m. A taxi driver has just dropped off revelers at a remote house in 
	  Hethersgill, Cumbria, England. She heads home down a remote track toward the main road when 
	  suddenly her CB radio begins to crackle then fades entirely. Moments later her car engine and 
	  lights fail, and she coasts to a stop. She gets out, hoping to walk back to the house, when 
	  she sees a ball of light low over the road heading towards her. It swoops over her car and 
	  shoots into the sky, causing her skin to tingle. The headlights come back on, the car lurches 
	  forward, and she hears her sister talking on the CB asking where she has been for the past 30 
	  minutes. (Jenny Randles, “The Twelve UFOs of Christmas,” Fortean Times 374 (Christmas 2018): 
	  29)</p>
