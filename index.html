	  <p>A physicist and his wife are traveling north on US Highway 99 north of Bakersfield, 
	  California, and pull off to the side to watch a long, slender object of a blazing red, 
	  green, and yellow color moving about 8 miles east of them. It is traveling at about 50 
	  mph at an altitude of 200–300 feet and is clearly outlined against the foothills. It 
	  seems to be several times longer than a bomber. (“Recent Sightings,” APRO Bulletin,

	  <p>1:00 a.m. A woman returning home in Prouvy, Nord, France, finds herself face-to-face with 
	  three small entities with large round heads and short beards. They have large, luminous yellow 
	  eyes and wear tight, one-piece suits with a metallic sheen that leave only their faces exposed. 
	  The beings stare at her without moving, so she goes inside to get her husband, but by the time 
	  they return the entities have gone. (Center for UFO Studies, HUMCAT Index 1940–1949, p. 3;

	  <p>May 26 — Late night. Capt. Ray Smith and copilot Sgt. Gordon N. Cockcroft are flying at 
	  18,000 feet in a Halifax bomber on a run near Essen, Germany, when they see a silvery-gold 
	  cylindrical object, larger than their aircraft, on the port side. It has several evenly 
	  spaced portholes. It is hovering at a 45° angle. After 20–30 seconds it climbs away at high 
	  speed. (Norman Oliver, “Report—Extra!” BUFORA Journal 6, no. 3 (Sept./Oct. 1977): cover,

	  <p>July 18 — A French prisoner in a German labor camp near Gdynia, Poland, is walking to work 
	  along the Baltic Sea when he sees a flat, metallic object embedded in the sand. A human figure 
	  is standing next to it, apparently trying to dig it up. When he passes by, the figure, 
	  apparently an Asian woman with long blonde hair and dressed in a tight-fitting overall, turns 
	  in his direction. The witness assumes she is the famous German aviator Hanna Reitsch and helps 
	  her dig the experimental aircraft out of the sand. The object is 20 feet in diameter and looks 
	  like two metallic saucers put together. The woman touches the witness’s chest with her hand 
	  and points to the sky. She touches her belt and a door in the object opens. She crawls inside, 
	  the door closes, and the object ascends and departs at a tremendous speed. (Jean Sider,

	  <p>January 2 — The New York Times publishes an article stating that the foo fighters are 
	  German weapons. Lieut. Donald J. Meiers of the 415th Night Fighter Squadron says he has been 
	  followed by foo-fighters twice in November 1944. “A foo-fighter picked me up at 700 feet and 
	  chased me 20 miles down the Rhine Valley [Germany]. I turned to starboard and two balls of

      <p>Mid-February — As their C-47 prepares to land at Biggs Field, Fort Bliss, El Paso, Texas, 
	  S/Sgt Ralph Bayer is alarmed to see an aircraft approaching from the left and only 900 feet

      <p>Late March — At least two residents of Dresden, Germany, see a round, flat, silver-colored 
	  object without propellors or wings hovering silently in the air. It suddenly disappears like 
	  a “burst soap bubble.” (“Weltrundschau,” Weltraumbote, no. 32/22 (July/Aug. 1958): 14–15;

      <p>March 26 — During an air operation, Lieut. Calvin P. Lamb (pilot), Lieut. James G. Holmes 
	  (radar observer), and Sgt. John W. McIsaac (gunner) notice lights on an airborne object. The 
	  lights follow them through a few turns but move away as the crew orbits north of Iwo Jima, 
	  Japan. They give chase, obtaining a slight target on the aircraft radar, then the object pulls 
	  out of sight. A similar lighted object is again seen March 28 by Lieut. William F. Sill 
	  (pilot), Flight Officer George W. Hayden (radar observer), and PFC William Brasvell (gunner).

      <p>December 25 — A witness is standing on the shore during a blizzard on a small island off 
	  the west coast of Ireland, waiting for a boat that will return him to the mainland, when a 
	  silver domed object with a square base descends from the clouds and lands on the water. It 
	  is surrounded by purple lights and emits a whirring noise, resembling a drill. The object 
	  rises again and lands in a field, crushing two cows. The top of the craft slides open, and 
	  two humanoid figures with “squarish legs” and wearing gray-black rubber suits emerge. One 
	  of them walks across the water to the shore, placing a large vial on the ground. The other 
	  fires a red ray at a cow, burning through it. A farmer’s dog approaches, barking, but the 
	  humanoid points a “box with lights and antennae” at it, hypnotizing the dog. The dog then 
	  walks up to the UFO and is taken aboard. Five or six similar craft streak overhead as a mist
	  envelops the UFO. Both beings float back into the craft. Before leaving, one of the beings 
	  notices the witness and waves. Startled, the witness runs away. The farmer later advises the 
	  witness to keep the experience a secret. (Mark Malony, “A New Irish Close Encounter Report,”

      <p>Summer — Late evening. Two women on a walk in Johannesburg, South Africa, see an aerial 
	  object hovering 5 feet above the roof of a nearby hotel. It is shaped like a saucer with a 
	  round, golden ball in the center, evenly split between the top and bottom sections. They 
	  hear a clicking noise, and the ball drops through the saucer until it is level with the 
	  roof. More clicks are heard, and the ball rises through and above the saucer 8–9 feet. 
	  In the space between the ball and the disc the witnesses see two figures larger than 
	  normal height (7 feet), fair-complexioned and broad-shouldered, with short wavy hair. They 
	  are wearing white uniforms with stiff collars and stand motionless until the object floats 
	  away and is lost to view. (John Judge, “Near-Landing in 1946 in Johannesburg,” Flying Saucer

      <p>February 23 — 8:30 a.m. Frederick S. Briggs, a bricklayer and former army sergeant employed 
	  at Broadlands, Romsey, Hampshire, England, the manor then owned by Lord Mountbatten, Prince 
	  Philip’s uncle, sees a large disc-shaped UFO over a nearby meadow as he is bicycling to work. 
	  The object is shaped like a spinning top, metallic, and about 20–30 feet in diameter with 
	  portholes around the center. Watching from less than 100 yards away, Briggs estimates that 
	  the object is 80 feet above the ground. He sees a humanoid figure dressed in what look like 
	  overalls and a helmet descend from the craft on some sort of column with a platform at the 
	  bottom. He is then dazzled by a bright blue light from the craft and falls over, unable to 
	  move, as if held by a strange force. The UFO then flies off at high speed. Mountbatten takes 
	  a personal interest in this incident, interviews Briggs, and searches the area of the meadow 
	  over which the UFO is seen. He subsequently has a statement prepared, detailing Briggs’s 
	  claims. This story is written up by Desmond Leslie in Flying Saucer Review in 1981.

      <p> January 8 — 7:00 a.m. Four Chilean researchers on Robert Island, in the South Shetland 
	  Islands, Antarctica, see two silent, metallic objects hovering in the sky in an upright 
	  position. One is almost on the meridian, while the other is about 30° from it, reflecting 
	  the sun’s rays. Each has the apparent diameter of the full moon. Around 9:00 a.m., the lower 
	  object shifts to a horizontal position, shoots off to the west, loses its metallic luster, 
	  and makes an acute angle turn without changing speed. Then it performs some zigzag maneuvers, 
	  braking sharply and accelerating instantly, then returns to its original position after 5 
	  minutes. Shortly afterward, the second object conducts similar maneuvers for 3 minutes. The 
	  team’s Geiger counter indicates that the ambient radioactivity has increased to a dangerous 
	  40 times the background. They take several photos, color and black-and-white, of the UFOs. 
	  The objects remain in the sky, but at dusk the researchers walk north along the coast and 
	  take refuge in a moraine. They see the objects moving past the summit of a mountain and 
	  shooting a flash of light. During the night, some cirrus clouds allow the team to determine 
	  that the objects are at an altitude of nearly 5 miles and their length is around 500 feet. At 
	  11:00 p.m. a snowstorm sets in and clouds cover the objects. The Geiger counter indicates

	  the ionosphere and investigate the potential for developing ionospheric enhancement technology 
	  for radio communications and surveillance. As a university-owned facility, HAARP is a high-
	  power, high-frequency transmitter used for study of the ionosphere. The most prominent 
	  instrument at HAARP is the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), a high-power radio frequency
	  transmitter facility operating in the high frequency band. The IRI is used to temporarily 
	  excite a limited area of the ionosphere. Other instruments, such as a VHF and a UHF radar, a 
	  fluxgate magnetometer, a digisonde (an ionospheric sounding device), and an induction 
	  magnetometer, are used to study the physical processes that occur in the excited region.

	  <p> January 1 — 1:30 a.m. A taxi driver has just dropped off revelers at a remote house in 
	  Hethersgill, Cumbria, England. She heads home down a remote track toward the main road when 
	  suddenly her CB radio begins to crackle then fades entirely. Moments later her car engine and 
	  lights fail, and she coasts to a stop. She gets out, hoping to walk back to the house, when 
	  she sees a ball of light low over the road heading towards her. It swoops over her car and 
	  shoots into the sky, causing her skin to tingle. The headlights come back on, the car lurches 
	  forward, and she hears her sister talking on the CB asking where she has been for the past 30 
	  minutes. (Jenny Randles, “The Twelve UFOs of Christmas,” Fortean Times 374 (Christmas 2018): 
	  29)</p>
