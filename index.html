	  <p>A physicist and his wife are traveling north on US Highway 99 north of Bakersfield, 
	  California, and pull off to the side to watch a long, slender object of a blazing red, 
	  green, and yellow color moving about 8 miles east of them. It is traveling at about 50 
	  mph at an altitude of 200–300 feet and is clearly outlined against the foothills. It 
	  seems to be several times longer than a bomber. (“Recent Sightings,” APRO Bulletin,

	  <p>1:00 a.m. A woman returning home in Prouvy, Nord, France, finds herself face-to-face with 
	  three small entities with large round heads and short beards. They have large, luminous yellow 
	  eyes and wear tight, one-piece suits with a metallic sheen that leave only their faces exposed. 
	  The beings stare at her without moving, so she goes inside to get her husband, but by the time 
	  they return the entities have gone. (Center for UFO Studies, HUMCAT Index 1940–1949, p. 3;

	  <p>May 26 — Late night. Capt. Ray Smith and copilot Sgt. Gordon N. Cockcroft are flying at 
	  18,000 feet in a Halifax bomber on a run near Essen, Germany, when they see a silvery-gold 
	  cylindrical object, larger than their aircraft, on the port side. It has several evenly 
	  spaced portholes. It is hovering at a 45° angle. After 20–30 seconds it climbs away at high 
	  speed. (Norman Oliver, “Report—Extra!” BUFORA Journal 6, no. 3 (Sept./Oct. 1977): cover,

	  <p>July 18 — A French prisoner in a German labor camp near Gdynia, Poland, is walking to work 
	  along the Baltic Sea when he sees a flat, metallic object embedded in the sand. A human figure 
	  is standing next to it, apparently trying to dig it up. When he passes by, the figure, 
	  apparently an Asian woman with long blonde hair and dressed in a tight-fitting overall, turns 
	  in his direction. The witness assumes she is the famous German aviator Hanna Reitsch and helps 
	  her dig the experimental aircraft out of the sand. The object is 20 feet in diameter and looks 
	  like two metallic saucers put together. The woman touches the witness’s chest with her hand 
	  and points to the sky. She touches her belt and a door in the object opens. She crawls inside, 
	  the door closes, and the object ascends and departs at a tremendous speed. (Jean Sider, 
	  Ultra Top-Secret: Ces OVNIs qui font peur, Axis Mundi, 1990)</p>
	  <p>September — During an air battle between the Germans and Russians, a member of the Spanish 
	  Blue Division fighting with the Germans near Pushkin outside Leningrad [now Saint Petersburg], 
	  Russia, notices a disc-shaped object above the planes. It appears to be observing the battle, 
	  then disappears at a fantastic speed. (Antonio Ribera, Platillos Volantes en Iberoamerica y

	  <p>February 24 —Night. Southwest of Saint-Quentin, Aisne, France, three silver objects are 
	  seen by an RAF bomber returning from a mission over Schweinfurt, Germany. They resemble 
	  Zeppelins but move independently of the wind. (Strange Company 60)</p>

	  <p>January 2 — The New York Times publishes an article stating that the foo fighters are German weapons. Lieut.
Donald J. Meiers of the 415th Night Fighter Squadron says he has been followed by foo-fighters twice in
November 1944. “A foo-fighter picked me up at 700 feet and chased me 20 miles down the Rhine Valley
[Germany]. I turned to starboard and two balls of fire turned with me. I turned to the port side and they turned
with me. We were going 260 miles an hour and the balls were keeping right up with us.” (“Balls of Fire Stalk
U.S. Fighters in Night Assaults over Germany,” New York Times, January 2, 1945, pp. 1, 4; “Science: Foo-
Fighter,” Time, January 15, 1945, p. 72; Strange Company 117–118)</p>
      <p>January 22 — British prisoners being force-marched out of the German Heydebreck labor camp (near modern
Kędzierzyn-Koźle, Poland) see a four-engine bomber overhead. Behind it is a “brilliant light” that is following it
closely. (Clark III 503; Clark IV 552</p>
      <p>January 30 — Capt. Fred B. Ringwald, intelligence officer for the 415 Night Fighter Squadron, responds to
Corning’s January 16 request by offering a summary of 14 foo fighter reports from December 14, 1944, to
January 29, 1945. ([Memo], Fred B. Ringwald to AC of S A-2 XII Tactical Air Command, January 30, 1945;
Strange Company 129–132)</p>
      <p>Mid-February — As their C-47 prepares to land at Biggs Field, Fort Bliss, El Paso, Texas, S/Sgt Ralph Bayer is
alarmed to see an aircraft approaching from the left and only 900 feet below them. The object is about 30 feet
long and a dull, flat gray in color, and it travels in a straight course 500 feet above the ground until it disappears.
(Clark III 1178; Clark IV 1352)</p>
      <p>Late March — At least two residents of Dresden, Germany, see a round, flat, silver-colored object without
propellors or wings hovering silently in the air. It suddenly disappears like a “burst soap bubble.”
(“Weltrundschau,” Weltraumbote, no. 32/22 (July/Aug. 1958): 14–15; Clark III 503; Clark IV 552)</p>
      <p>March 26 — During an air operation, Lieut. Calvin P. Lamb (pilot), Lieut. James G. Holmes (radar observer), and
Sgt. John W. McIsaac (gunner) notice lights on an airborne object. The lights follow them through a few turns but
move away as the crew orbits north of Iwo Jima, Japan. They give chase, obtaining a slight target on the aircraft
radar, then the object pulls out of sight. A similar lighted object is again seen March 28 by Lieut. William F. Sill
(pilot), Flight Officer George W. Hayden (radar observer), and PFC William Brasvell (gunner). (Project 1947,
“UFO Reports, 1945”</p>
      <p>December 25 — A witness is standing on the shore during a blizzard on a small island off the west coast of Ireland,
waiting for a boat that will return him to the mainland, when a silver domed object with a square base descends
from the clouds and lands on the water. It is surrounded by purple lights and emits a whirring noise, resembling a
drill. The object rises again and lands in a field, crushing two cows. The top of the craft slides open, and two
humanoid figures with “squarish legs” and wearing gray-black rubber suits emerge. One of them walks across the
water to the shore, placing a large vial on the ground. The other fires a red ray at a cow, burning through it. A
farmer’s dog approaches, barking, but the humanoid points a “box with lights and antennae” at it, hypnotizing the
dog. The dog then walks up to the UFO and is taken aboard. Five or six similar craft streak overhead as a mist
envelops the UFO. Both beings float back into the craft. Before leaving, one of the beings notices the witness and
waves. Startled, the witness runs away. The farmer later advises the witness to keep the experience a secret. (Mark

Report, Part 2,” Northern UFO News, no. 31 (December 1976): 4)</p>
	  <p>A slow-moving object, 25–35 feet in diameter, comes within 225 feet of a witness in 
	  Sheffield, Yorkshire, England. Through a large window he can see 6-feet-tall beings with 
	  short legs, short hair, and one-piece suits. (“Ufonauts Seen in 1945,” Northern UFO News, no.

	  <p>Dancers on the roof of a nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey, watch the rapid passage of four 
	  square-shaped lights, reddish in color and aligned side by side, moving from the east and 
	  disappearing in the west in less than 60 seconds. One witness, meteorologist and RAF pilot 
	  George Raymond Leatherbarrow, estimates their altitude at 50,000 feet based on reflections 
	  on cirrus clouds. (G. R. Leatherbarrow, “Two Early UFO Cases from the Middle East,” Awareness 
	  5, no. 3 (Autumn 1976): 4–5; Clark III 1177; Clark IV 1352)</p>
      <p>3:30 a.m. May Ackerman is awakened by a brilliant light shining in her bedroom in northwest 
	  Detroit, Michigan. It comes from a silent, luminous oval object with a transparent band across 
	  its midsection that is hovering in her neighbor’s yard. Inside the band is a humanoid. The 
	  object departs abruptly. (“West Side Detroit Woman Sights Strange Craft and ‘Navigator’ in 
	  1946,” Vimana 1, no. 1 (October 1954): 2, 4; Clark III 266: Clark IV 306)</p> 
      <p> April or May — Around 12:00 noon. Richard R. Hill and Stanley Ogdrzyiak are driving in an 
	  open convertible on the Country Club Road near Lafayette, New York. Suddenly they see a 
	  gleaming, metallic, cigar-shaped object in the sky. It remains motionless at 5,000–10,000 
	  feet altitude, which at that height would make it 300–400 feet long. After 2 minutes, it 
	  disappears instantaneously. (“Case 84,” CRIFO Newsletter 2, no. 3 (June 3, 1955): 4;
	  Clark III 1179; Clark IV 1353</p>
      <p>May — Day. Navy Lieutenant Andrew A. Titcomb is on leave and picking oranges at his wife’s 
	  family home at La Grange, north of Titusville, Florida, when he hears a whistling noise and 
	  sees a dark “flying football” directly overhead at about 1,000 feet elevation moving at 125 
	  mph. It appears 15–20 feet in diameter and flies in an arc tothe southeast. It disappears in 
	  a cloudbank. (UFOEv, p. 6; Clark III 1179; Clark IV 1353)</p>
      <p> May 24 — 2:20 a.m. Witnesses in Landskrona, Sweden, see a wingless, cigar-shaped object, 
	  spurting sparks from its tail. About 300 feet above the ground, it is moving at airplane 
	  speed toward the southwest. (Loren E. Gross, UFO’s, a History: 1946, the Ghost Rockets, The 
	  Author, 1988 ed., p. 1; Göran Jansson, “Spökraketerna 1946,” January 2005, p. 6; Clark III 
	  524; Clark IV 573</p>
      <p>Summer — Late evening. Two women on a walk in Johannesburg, South Africa, see an aerial 
	  object hovering 5 feet above the roof of a nearby hotel. It is shaped like a saucer with a 
	  round, golden ball in the center, evenly split between the top and bottom sections. They 
	  hear a clicking noise, and the ball drops through the saucer until it is level with the 
	  roof. More clicks are heard, and the ball rises through and above the saucer 8–9 feet. 
	  In the space between the ball and the disc the witnesses see two figures larger than 
	  normal height (7 feet), fair-complexioned and broad-shouldered, with short wavy hair. They 
	  are wearing white uniforms with stiff collars and stand motionless until the object floats 
	  away and is lost to view. (John Judge, “Near-Landing in 1946 in Johannesburg,” Flying Saucer 
	  Review 24, no. 5 (March 1979): 14–16; Clark III 266; Clark IV 306)</p>
	  <p>July — Day. A long, silver-colored cigar appears suddenly out of the haze over Crane Beach, 
	  Ipswich, Massachusetts, moves noiselessly over the water, then disappears suddenly. (Lore and 
	  Deneault, p. 148; Clark III 1179; Clark IV 1353)</p>
      <p>July — 2:00 p.m. Hans Sorensen is cycling near Viskinge, Denmark, when he sees three discs 
	  flying silently overhead. The underside is uneven and dull gray, but they are like “polished 
	  mirrors” on top. (Sjællands Tidende (Ringsted, Denmark), April 17, 1971; Loren E. Gross, UFO’s, 
	  a History: 1946, the Ghost Rockets, The Author, 1988 ed., p. 16; Clark III 528; Clark IV 577)</p>
      <p>August — 8:30 p.m. A young man sees a pan-shaped object near a road in Sint-Niklaas, 
	  Belgium. A small entity holding an acacia branch is nearby. The being enters the object through 
	  an opening on the underside. Afterward, traces of burning on the ground are detected. (Center 
	  for UFO Studies, HUMCAT Index 1940–1949, p. 20; Clark III 266; Clark IV 306)</p>
      <p>Late August — Margaret Sprankle, a civilian employee at Tinker AFB near Oklahoma City, 
	  Oklahoma, is returning from work when she sees, about 300 feet away, a large, metallic, lens-
	  shaped structure about 75 feet in diameter. It is hovering on edge, the flat side toward her. 
	  On the lower right side are 12–14 square windows; in each, visible from the shoulders up, is 
	  a figure. Their heads are very round. Aftre about 90 seconds, the object rotates 90° on its 
	  vertical axis and silently flies northwest and disappears in 5 seconds. (Center for UFO Studies, 
	  HUMCAT Index 1940–1949, p. 22; Richard H. Hall, From Airships to Arnold, UFO Research Coalition,

  	  <p>A man writes a letter to the Nashville Tennessean claiming that he has encountered strange 
	  little men, “all heads and arms and legs, glowing like fireflies” on a nearby airfield. They 
	  exchange greetings by sign language and their saucer takes off in a cloud of dust. (“All over 
	  the Nation People Talk of Saucers,” Nashville Tennessean, July 9, 1947, p. 1; Clark III 266–

      <p>A private pilot flying over New Mexico in his Taylorcraft L-2 allegedly spots some 
	  wreckage, lands, and goes to a nearby ranch house. The pilot and rancher walk to the site, 
	  where they find much metallic material. Inside the front edge of the craft are three humanoid 
	  beings, 4 feet tall, with hairless heads and large black eyes, and clad in coveralls. Soon a 
	  military team shows up, detained for a while, then released after promising not to say 
	  anything. (Clark III 344; Clark IV 381–382)</p>

	  <p>Late April or early May — 12:05 p.m. Mrs. William Down and Mrs. H. G. Olavick of Tucson, 
	  Arizona, see an unusual, fleecy cloud in an otherwise cloudless sky. Moving around it in 
	  “yo-yo fashion” are a number of small discs with a dull-white finish. They move up and down 
	  and sideways, occasionally disappearing into or behind the cloud. They watch the objects for 
	  5–7 minutes, then all the discs disappear above the cloud, while a larger object emerges from 
	  the cloud and moves eastward. Behind it comes a V-formation of nine of the smaller discs, 
	  which then climbs at high speed toward the northeast and disappears in 2–3 seconds. The 
	  witnesses assume the objects are some new type of aircraft. (Bloecher, p. ix; Herbert S. 
	  Taylor, “Satellite Objects and Cloud Cigars,” IUR 29, no. 1 (Spring 2004): 4)</p>
      <p>May — Farmer H. Nettlebeck is in his field near Gogeldrie, New South Wales, when he hears 
	  a swishing noise. Looking up, he sees five metallic objects flying in a V formation. They 
	  appear to be at 2,000 feet altuitude and moving at 1,000 mph. (“Flying Discs Seen over 
	  Gogeldrie,” Murrumbidgee Irrigator (Leeton, N.S.W.), July 8, 1947, p. 2)</p>
      <p>May 19 — Around 12:30 p.m. Navy veteran Dean A. Hauser and six other Pike’s Peak Railway 
	  workers (including Ted Weigand, Marion Hisshouse, T. J. Smith, L. D. Jamison) at Manitou 
	  Springs, Colorado, are taking a lunch break when they watch a silver object come in from the 
	  northwest, hover overhead, and gyrate at 1,000 feet. The UFO is moving “erratically in wide 
	  circles” and reflects light like it is made of metal. After 20 minutes it disappears in a 
	  straight line to the west-northwest. (“Manitou Vets Relate Story: Another ‘Disk’ Seen,”

      <p>Late May — 11:00 a.m. Colden R. Battey, a physician from Augusta, Georgia, is fishing 10 
	  miles off St. Helena Sound, near Beaufort, South Carolina. He notices a formation of four 
	  disc-like objects flying overhead in a southeasterly direction at a terrific rate of speed. 
	  The discs appear to be spinning on their axes and are at an estimated altitude of 20,000 feet. 
	  They are silvery and appear highly polished, and on their undersides Battey can see a circular 
	  rim or projection, about one-quarter of the way from the edges. No sound is heard as they fly
	  overhead. The formation speeds out of view in less than 20 seconds. (NICAP, “Four Discs Flying 
	  Overhead”; “‘Flying Saucers’ Seen by Doctor near Beaufort,” Orangeburg (S.C.) Times and Democrat, 
	  July 5, 1947, p. 1; Bloecher, p. I-2; Clark III 375; Clark IV 419)</p>
      <p>June 2 — 1:30 p.m. John Laube and Fred Platte spot an inverted saucer-shaped disc made of 
	  brilliant metal in Waverly, Iowa. The object flies just above the top of a 180-foot grain 
	  elevator at the Waverly Sugar Manufacturing Plant. They observe it for five minutes until it 
	  becomes obscured by trees as it flies away. (“Flying Saucer Is Seen at Waverly,” Waterloo (Iowa) 
	  Daily Courier, July 10, 1947, p. 21)</p> 
      <p>June 18 — Day. E. H. Sprinkle is one of a half-dozen Eugene, Oregon, residents who spot a 
	  formation of round objects “racing overhead” on a course to the northeast. Watching from

      <p>July 4 — 1:05–5:30 p.m. Many people in Portland, Oregon—including KOIN newsman Frank 
	  Cooley, deputy Clark County Sheriff Fred Krives, Portland police officer Kenneth A. McDowell, 
	  and Oregon highway patrol Sgt. Claude Cross—view five large discs moving at high speed to the 
	  east, two flying south and three to the east, with an oscillating or wobbling motion, sudden 
	  90° turns or zigzagging. Radio reports alert other officers (including Walter Lissy, Robert

	  disc or hubcap or pie-pan or half-moon flashing in the sun. No vapor trail or noise (except 
	  possible humming) is reported. (NICAP, “Seven Discs Observed by Many Witnesses”; Sparks, p.

	  heads to the closest phone to tell Sheriff George A. Wilcox of the discovery of the remains 
	  of a crashed aircraft of some kind. Wilcox calls the local fire department to alert them 
	  about the crash. One truck, with Dan Dwyer on it, responds to the call. The site is about 
	  35–40 miles north of Roswell. The Roswell Fire Department, escorted by members of the

	  pieces of lightweight balsawood-like material only stronger, light metallic foil (which 
	  doesn’t stay bent or folded, resumes its original shape, and won’t tear), and heavy-gauge 
	  monofilament. The debris is thick enough that the sheep refuse to cross the field and are 
	  driven around it to water more than a mile away. Brazel, taking a few scraps of the material, 
	  heads to the home of his closest neighbors, Floyd and Loretta Proctor. He shows them “a

steady light flying an erratic course at about 20,000 feet from the north horizon to the base area. It moves over the
base at high speed (faster than a jet), zig-zagging, stopping, and maneuvering again. After 10 minutes, it shoots
straight up and disappears to the west. (NICAP, “Object Zig-Zags over Base”; Sparks, p. 124)</p>
      <p>April 23 — 10:45 a.m. Engineers Carl Hawk and Marvin Harvey are at Sandia Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico,

soundless, flat, rectangular, wing-like object streaking through the sky from east to west above Tijeras Canyon.
The object is completely black except for a distinct, bright yellow “V” on its bottom. Two slight points extend
from its rear corners. Hawk estimates that it is passing overhead at 2,000 feet altitude at 200–400 mph and is
roughly 60 feet wide by 20 feet long. They watch it for 10 seconds until it disappears in a cloud above downtown
Albuquerque. (“What Soared Across Duke City Sky That Day in April, 1952?”Albuquerque (N.Mex.) Tribune,

	  the ionosphere and investigate the potential for developing ionospheric enhancement technology 
	  for radio communications and surveillance. As a university-owned facility, HAARP is a high-
	  power, high-frequency transmitter used for study of the ionosphere. The most prominent 
	  instrument at HAARP is the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), a high-power radio frequency
	  transmitter facility operating in the high frequency band. The IRI is used to temporarily 
	  excite a limited area of the ionosphere. Other instruments, such as a VHF and a UHF radar, a 
	  fluxgate magnetometer, a digisonde (an ionospheric sounding device), and an induction 
	  magnetometer, are used to study the physical processes that occur in the excited region.
